                      <h2>Panda</h2>
                      <p> The giant panda is a bear species endemic to China.
                           It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body</p>

                             <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                             <ol>
                               <li><strong>Size and Appearance:</strong>
                                    Giant pandas are large bears, with males typically weighing between 220 and 250 pounds 
                                    (100 to 115 kilograms) 
                                    and measuring around 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) in length. Females are smaller, 
                                    weighing between 150 and 220 pounds (68 to 100 kilograms). 
                                    They have a robust body, with a round face, large head, and black fur on their ears, eye patches, 
                                    limbs, and shoulders. 
                                    The rest of their body is covered in dense, woolly fur that is mostly white with black patches.
                                    
                               </li>
                               <li><strong>Adaptations:</strong>
                                    andas have several unique adaptations that help them survive in their bamboo forest habitat. 
                                    They have a "pseudo-thumb" or an extension of the wrist bone that functions like a thumb, allowing them to 
                                    grasp bamboo stems and manipulate objects. Their jaws are strong, 
                                    and their molars and premolars are broad and flat, enabling them to chew and crush bamboo effectively.
                               </li>
                               <li> <strong>Diet:</strong>
                                    As mentioned earlier, the giant panda's diet primarily consists of bamboo. 
                                    They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from bamboo, 
                                    despite its low nutritional value. However, pandas also have the ability to eat other foods such as fruits, 
                                    vegetables, and occasionally small mammals or eggs, 
                                    although these items make up a very small proportion of their diet.
                               </li>
                               <li><strong>Habitat:</strong>
                                    Giant pandas inhabit the mountainous regions of central China, 
                                    where they live in dense bamboo forests at elevations between 1,200 and 3,500 meters 
                                    (4,000 to 11,500 feet) above sea level. 
                                    They require a large area of undisturbed bamboo forest to meet their dietary needs and to
                                     maintain a stable population.
                               </li>
                               <li><strong>Behavior:</strong>
                                    Pandas are generally solitary animals, with individuals occupying home ranges that overlap with those of other pandas.
                                     They are primarily active during the day and spend a significant amount of time foraging and feeding on bamboo.
                                     Pandas are adept climbers and often retreat to trees to rest or escape from predators. 
                                     They are also good swimmers.
                               </li>
                               <li><strong>Conservation Status: </strong>
                                    The giant panda is listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 
                                    They have faced threats such as habitat loss, fragmentation, and poaching. 
                                    However, significant conservation efforts have been made to protect and restore their habitat, 
                                    and their population has shown some positive recovery in recent years.

                             <h3>Fun facts</h3>
                             <ul>
                               <li>Giant pandas are known for their distinct black and white markings, which help camouflage them in 
                                    their bamboo forest habitat and provide effective camouflage in the snowy 
                                    landscapes of their native regions.</li>
                               <li>Despite their bear-like appearance, pandas have a diet that is primarily herbivorous. 
                               They are one of the few bear species that are mainly vegetarian, feeding almost exclusively on bamboo.</li>
                               <li>Pandas have a specialized "thumb" or an extension of their wrist bone that functions like a thumb.
                                This adaptation allows them to grasp bamboo stems and efficiently strip the leaves.</li>
                               <li>Pandas have a unique way of marking their territory. 
                                    They use scent marking, such as rubbing their bodies against trees or urinating on objects, 
                                    to communicate their presence and establish boundaries.</li>
                               <li>Baby pandas, called cubs, are born blind and are extremely small and fragile. 
                                They are about the size of a stick of butter and weigh only 3.5 to 5 ounces (100 to 150 grams) at birth.</li>
                               <li>Pandas are excellent climbers and are capable of climbing trees, even though they are quite heavy. 
                               Their climbing ability allows them to access bamboo shoots at higher elevations.</li>
                               <li>Pandas have a specialized digestive system, but it is not very efficient at extracting nutrients from bamboo.
                                     As a result, they have to consume a large volume of bamboo to meet their nutritional needs,
                                     spending about 10 to 16 hours a day feeding.</li>
                               <li>Despite their large size, pandas have a gentle temperament and are generally docile. 
                                    They are often depicted as adorable and cuddly creatures, 
                                    which contributes to their popularity and conservation efforts.</li>
                               <li>Pandas have been a symbol of conservation and wildlife preservation.
                                     They are considered a flagship species for biodiversity conservation in China and around the world.
                                      Their iconic image has helped raise awareness 
                                    and support for the protection of their habitat and other endangered species.</li>
