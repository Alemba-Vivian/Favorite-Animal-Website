            <h2>Lion</h2>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
              (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is 
              second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial “king of beasts,” <br>
              the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest
              times.Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of
              habitats <br> but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open
              woodland.Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and
              Africa, <br> but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of
              the Sahara.An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions
              constitute <br> a slightly smaller race that lives under strict
              protection in India’s Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.

              <h3>Diet</h3>
              <p>
                Lions are carnivores, which means they are animals that only eat
                meat. <br />
                Some of the types of prey they catch include:

              <h3>Characteristics</h3>
              <li>Lions are one of the largest big cat species</li>
              <li>
                One of the most iconic features of male lions is their impressive
                mane. <br> It is a thick growth of hair that surrounds the neck and
                head, and its color ranges from blonde to black. <br> The mane serves
                multiple purposes, including protection, visual display, and
                signaling dominance within the pride
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions have a short, coarse coat that varies in color from light
                yellowish-brown to reddish-brown. <br> The underside and inner legs are
                often lighter in color. Both males and females possess a coat, <br> but
                males typically have a thicker and more prominent mane.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions have a large head with a well-defined muzzle. Their face is
                characterized by a pair of round, <br> prominent eyes that provide
                excellent vision, especially during low light conditions. <br> Lions
                also have a well-developed sense of hearing and a strong sense of
                smell
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions are highly social animals and are the only cats that form
                social groups called prides. <br> Prides typically consist of related
                females, their offspring, and a small number of adult males. <br> The
                females are responsible for hunting, while the males defend the
                pride's territory and protect the cubs
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions are known for their powerful roar, which can be heard from
                several miles away. <br> Roaring is a form of vocal communication used
                by males to assert their dominance, <br> advertise their presence, and
                communicate with members of their pride.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions are apex predators and primarily feed on large ungulates
                such as wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Male lions establish and defend territories, which encompass the
                range of one or more prides. <br> They mark their territories with
                scent markings and vocalizations to deter other males from
                encroaching
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions are found in various habitats across sub-Saharan Africa,
                including grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands. <br> They are well
                adapted to these environments, with their tawny coat providing
                effective camouflage in the surrounding vegetation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <h3>Fun facts</h3>
              <li>
                Lions are the only big cats to live in groups, called prides.
                Prides are close family groups. <br> They work together to defend
                territory and hunt.
              </li>
              <li>
                The females in the pride tend to do the majority of the hunting. <br>
                They work as a group and use intelligent hunting tactics to catch <br>
                prey which they would not be able to catch alone as they are
                faster than them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and
                20 hours each day resting and sleeping. <br> They have few sweat glands
                so they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the
                day <br> and become more active at night when it is cooler.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lionesses are caring mothers who will even take care of a
                neglected cub, <br> allowing him/her to suckle and giving them a chance
                to survive. <br> Two or more lionesses in a group tend to give birth
                around the same time, <br> and the cubs are raised together. Cubs are
                extremely playful
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions roar to communicate their position to other prides. <br> A lion’s
                roar is the loudest of any big cat and can be heard up to 8 km
                away.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions have terrific night vision. They are 6 times more sensitive
                to light than humans. <br> This gives them a distinct advantage over
                some prey species when hunting at night.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions communicate through a range of behaviours and their
                expressive movements are very highly developed. <br> They will perform
                peaceful tactile actions such as licking each other and rubbing
                heads. <br> Head rubbing, or nuzzling, is a common greeting behaviour
                for lions. <br> They also communicate through a variety of
                vocalisations including purrs, <br> snarls, miaws and hissing. Their
                vocalisations also vary in intensity and pitch.
              </li>
              <li>
                The mane of the male lion is a distinctive characteristic of lions
                as no other big cats have them. <br> It makes male lions appear larger,
                thus allowing them to be more intimidating. <br> It also signals sexual
                maturity and health status; lionesses tend to favour denser and
                darker manes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lions are symbols of strength and courage and have been celebrated
                throughout history for these characteristics. <br> They are also common
                symbols for royalty and stateliness, hence the phrase ‘king of the
                jungle’.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ancient Egyptians venerated lions as their war dieties due to
                their strength, power and fierceness. <br> The famous sphinxes are just
                one of many mythical depictions of the lion in Egyptian culture
              </li>
