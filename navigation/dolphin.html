            <h2>Dolphin</h2>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
              Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals that belong to the
              family Delphinidae. They are known for their playful behavior, <br>
              remarkable intelligence, and unique adaptations for life in the
              water

              <h3>Characteristics</h3>
              <li>
                Dolphins have a streamlined body shape, which helps them swim
                swiftly through the water. <br> They typically have a fusiform body
                (tapered at both ends) with a prominent dorsal fin on their backs. <br>
                Their skin is smooth and rubbery, often gray in color, although it
                can vary among species
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphin species vary in size, ranging from the smallest, such as
                the Maui's dolphin, <br> which grows to around 4 feet (1.2 meters) and
                weighs about 90 pounds (40 kilograms), <br> to the largest, such as the
                killer whale or orca, which can reach lengths of up to <br> 30 feet (9
                meters) and weigh over 10 tons (9,000 kilograms)
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are highly intelligent animals, known for their
                problem-solving abilities, <br> social cognition, and complex
                communication skills. <br> They exhibit self-awareness, demonstrate a
                wide range of behaviors, <br> and can learn and perform intricate tasks
                in captivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are known for their vocalizations and use a variety of
                clicks, <br> whistles, and body movements to communicate with one
                another. <br> These sounds serve various purposes, such as social
                bonding, navigation, <br> locating prey, and maintaining group
                cohesion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are highly social animals and often live in groups known
                as pods or schools. <br> Pod sizes can vary from a few individuals to
                several dozen, depending on the species. <br> Within the pod, dolphins
                engage in cooperative behaviors, communication, and hunting
                together.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are superb swimmers. They have a dorsal fin that helps
                with stability and maneuverability in the water. <br> Their tail
                flukes, which are horizontal, muscular structures, propel them
                through the water with great speed and agility.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are carnivorous and primarily feed on fish and squid. <br>
                Different species of dolphins have varying feeding habits and prey
                preferences. <br> They use echolocation (a type of biological sonar) to
                locate and track their prey, <br> emitting high-frequency clicks and
                interpreting the echoes that bounce back.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <h3>Fun facts</h3>
              <li>
                Dolphins are known for their playful behavior. They often ride the
                bow waves created by boats, <br> leap out of the water, and engage in
                acrobatic displays.They have been observed playing with seaweed, <br>
                blowing bubble rings, and tossing objects among themselves.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are incredibly agile and fast swimmers. <br> They can reach
                speeds of up to 20-25 miles per hour (32-40 kilometers per hour). <br>
                Their streamlined bodies, powerful tails, and efficient swimming
                techniques <br> allow them to move through the water with grace and
                speed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are highly social animals and live in complex social
                structures. <br> They form groups called pods or schools that can range
                in size from a few individuals to hundreds. <br> Within the pod, they
                exhibit strong social bonds, <br> communicate through vocalizations,
                and cooperate in hunting and raising offspring
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are among the most intelligent animals on Earth. <br> They
                have large brains relative to their body size and exhibit advanced
                problem-solving abilities. <br> Dolphins can learn complex
                tasks,recognize themselves in mirrors (a sign of self-awareness), <br>
                and show creative thinking in various situations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins use echolocation, a biological sonar system, <br> to navigate
                and locate prey in their underwater environment. <br> They emit clicks
                and listen to the echoes that bounce back, <br> allowing them to create
                a detailed auditory map of their surroundings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins have relatively long lifespans compared to many other
                animals. <br> Depending on the species, they can live anywhere from 20
                to 60 years or more. <br> Dolphins are also unique in that they employ
                a form of unihemispheric sleep, <br> where one half of their brain
                sleeps while the other remains <br> alert to ensure breathing and keep
                an eye out for predators.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are over 40 recognized species of dolphins, ranging in size,
                coloration, and habitat. <br> Some well-known species include the
                bottlenose dolphin, orca (killer whale), common dolphin, spinner
                dolphin, <br> and dusky dolphin. Each species has its own unique
                characteristics and behaviors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins often work together in coordinated hunting strategies. <br>
                They may encircle schools of fish, creating a tight ring or bubble
                net to trap the fish, <br> or use tail slaps to stun and corral prey. <br>
                This cooperative behavior enhances their hunting success and
                strengthens social bonds within the pod.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins are known to pass knowledge and behaviors from one
                generation to the next through cultural transmission. <br> This means
                that certain feeding techniques, vocalizations, <br> and play behaviors
                can be learned and shared within specific dolphin communities, <br>
                contributing to their social and cultural diversity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dolphins have a long history of interaction with humans and have
                been associated with positive and friendly encounters. <br> They are
                often portrayed as friendly and helpful creatures in stories and
                folklore, <br> and they have been known to approach and interact
                playfully with swimmers, surfers, and boats.
