          <h2>Lion</h2>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">
            (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is 
            second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial “king of beasts,” <br>
            the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest
            times.Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of
            habitats <br> but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open
            woodland.Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and
            Africa, <br> but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of
            the Sahara.An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions
            constitute <br> a slightly smaller race that lives under strict
            protection in India’s Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <li>Open plains</li>
            <li>Thick bush</li>

            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
              Lions are carnivores, which means they are animals that only eat
              meat. <br />
              Some of the types of prey they catch include:
            </p>
            <li>birds</li>
            <li>hares</li>
            <li>turtles</li>

          </ul>

          <ul>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <li>Lions are one of the largest big cat species</li>
            <li>
              One of the most iconic features of male lions is their impressive
              mane. <br> It is a thick growth of hair that surrounds the neck and
              head, and its color ranges from blonde to black. <br> The mane serves
              multiple purposes, including protection, visual display, and
              signaling dominance within the pride
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions have a short, coarse coat that varies in color from light
              yellowish-brown to reddish-brown. <br> The underside and inner legs are
              often lighter in color. Both males and females possess a coat, <br> but
              males typically have a thicker and more prominent mane.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions have a large head with a well-defined muzzle. Their face is
              characterized by a pair of round, <br> prominent eyes that provide
              excellent vision, especially during low light conditions. <br> Lions
              also have a well-developed sense of hearing and a strong sense of
              smell
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions are highly social animals and are the only cats that form
              social groups called prides. <br> Prides typically consist of related
              females, their offspring, and a small number of adult males. <br> The
              females are responsible for hunting, while the males defend the
              pride's territory and protect the cubs
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions are known for their powerful roar, which can be heard from
              several miles away. <br> Roaring is a form of vocal communication used
              by males to assert their dominance, <br> advertise their presence, and
              communicate with members of their pride.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions are apex predators and primarily feed on large ungulates
              such as wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Male lions establish and defend territories, which encompass the
              range of one or more prides. <br> They mark their territories with
              scent markings and vocalizations to deter other males from
              encroaching
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions are found in various habitats across sub-Saharan Africa,
              including grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands. <br> They are well
              adapted to these environments, with their tawny coat providing
              effective camouflage in the surrounding vegetation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Fun facts</h3>
            <li>
              Lions are the only big cats to live in groups, called prides.
              Prides are close family groups. <br> They work together to defend
              territory and hunt.
            </li>
            <li>
              The females in the pride tend to do the majority of the hunting. <br>
              They work as a group and use intelligent hunting tactics to catch <br>
              prey which they would not be able to catch alone as they are
              faster than them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and
              20 hours each day resting and sleeping. <br> They have few sweat glands
              so they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the
              day <br> and become more active at night when it is cooler.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lionesses are caring mothers who will even take care of a
              neglected cub, <br> allowing him/her to suckle and giving them a chance
              to survive. <br> Two or more lionesses in a group tend to give birth
              around the same time, <br> and the cubs are raised together. Cubs are
              extremely playful
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions roar to communicate their position to other prides. <br> A lion’s
              roar is the loudest of any big cat and can be heard up to 8 km
              away.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions have terrific night vision. They are 6 times more sensitive
              to light than humans. <br> This gives them a distinct advantage over
              some prey species when hunting at night.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions communicate through a range of behaviours and their
              expressive movements are very highly developed. <br> They will perform
              peaceful tactile actions such as licking each other and rubbing
              heads. <br> Head rubbing, or nuzzling, is a common greeting behaviour
              for lions. <br> They also communicate through a variety of
              vocalisations including purrs, <br> snarls, miaws and hissing. Their
              vocalisations also vary in intensity and pitch.
            </li>
            <li>
              The mane of the male lion is a distinctive characteristic of lions
              as no other big cats have them. <br> It makes male lions appear larger,
              thus allowing them to be more intimidating. <br> It also signals sexual
              maturity and health status; lionesses tend to favour denser and
              darker manes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lions are symbols of strength and courage and have been celebrated
              throughout history for these characteristics. <br> They are also common
              symbols for royalty and stateliness, hence the phrase ‘king of the
              jungle’.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ancient Egyptians venerated lions as their war dieties due to
              their strength, power and fierceness. <br> The famous sphinxes are just
              one of many mythical depictions of the lion in Egyptian culture

          <h2>Dolphin</h2>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">
            Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals that belong to the
            family Delphinidae. They are known for their playful behavior, <br>
            remarkable intelligence, and unique adaptations for life in the
            water
          </p>

          </ul>

          <ul>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <li>
              Dolphins have a streamlined body shape, which helps them swim
              swiftly through the water. <br> They typically have a fusiform body
              (tapered at both ends) with a prominent dorsal fin on their backs. <br>
              Their skin is smooth and rubbery, often gray in color, although it
              can vary among species
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphin species vary in size, ranging from the smallest, such as
              the Maui's dolphin, <br> which grows to around 4 feet (1.2 meters) and
              weighs about 90 pounds (40 kilograms), <br> to the largest, such as the
              killer whale or orca, which can reach lengths of up to <br> 30 feet (9
              meters) and weigh over 10 tons (9,000 kilograms)
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are highly intelligent animals, known for their
              problem-solving abilities, <br> social cognition, and complex
              communication skills. <br> They exhibit self-awareness, demonstrate a
              wide range of behaviors, <br> and can learn and perform intricate tasks
              in captivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are known for their vocalizations and use a variety of
              clicks, <br> whistles, and body movements to communicate with one
              another. <br> These sounds serve various purposes, such as social
              bonding, navigation, <br> locating prey, and maintaining group
              cohesion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are highly social animals and often live in groups known
              as pods or schools. <br> Pod sizes can vary from a few individuals to
              several dozen, depending on the species. <br> Within the pod, dolphins
              engage in cooperative behaviors, communication, and hunting
              together.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are superb swimmers. They have a dorsal fin that helps
              with stability and maneuverability in the water. <br> Their tail
              flukes, which are horizontal, muscular structures, propel them
              through the water with great speed and agility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are carnivorous and primarily feed on fish and squid. <br>
              Different species of dolphins have varying feeding habits and prey
              preferences. <br> They use echolocation (a type of biological sonar) to
              locate and track their prey, <br> emitting high-frequency clicks and
              interpreting the echoes that bounce back.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Fun facts</h3>
            <li>
              Dolphins are known for their playful behavior. They often ride the
              bow waves created by boats, <br> leap out of the water, and engage in
              acrobatic displays.They have been observed playing with seaweed, <br>
              blowing bubble rings, and tossing objects among themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are incredibly agile and fast swimmers. <br> They can reach
              speeds of up to 20-25 miles per hour (32-40 kilometers per hour). <br>
              Their streamlined bodies, powerful tails, and efficient swimming
              techniques <br> allow them to move through the water with grace and
              speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are highly social animals and live in complex social
              structures. <br> They form groups called pods or schools that can range
              in size from a few individuals to hundreds. <br> Within the pod, they
              exhibit strong social bonds, <br> communicate through vocalizations,
              and cooperate in hunting and raising offspring
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are among the most intelligent animals on Earth. <br> They
              have large brains relative to their body size and exhibit advanced
              problem-solving abilities. <br> Dolphins can learn complex
              tasks,recognize themselves in mirrors (a sign of self-awareness), <br>
              and show creative thinking in various situations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins use echolocation, a biological sonar system, <br> to navigate
              and locate prey in their underwater environment. <br> They emit clicks
              and listen to the echoes that bounce back, <br> allowing them to create
              a detailed auditory map of their surroundings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins have relatively long lifespans compared to many other
              animals. <br> Depending on the species, they can live anywhere from 20
              to 60 years or more. <br> Dolphins are also unique in that they employ
              a form of unihemispheric sleep, <br> where one half of their brain
              sleeps while the other remains <br> alert to ensure breathing and keep
              an eye out for predators.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are over 40 recognized species of dolphins, ranging in size,
              coloration, and habitat. <br> Some well-known species include the
              bottlenose dolphin, orca (killer whale), common dolphin, spinner
              dolphin, <br> and dusky dolphin. Each species has its own unique
              characteristics and behaviors.

              Dolphins often work together in coordinated hunting strategies. <br>
              They may encircle schools of fish, creating a tight ring or bubble
              net to trap the fish, <br> or use tail slaps to stun and corral prey. <br>
              This cooperative behavior enhances their hunting success and
              strengthens social bonds within the pod.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins are known to pass knowledge and behaviors from one
              generation to the next through cultural transmission. <br> This means
              that certain feeding techniques, vocalizations, <br> and play behaviors
              can be learned and shared within specific dolphin communities, <br>
              contributing to their social and cultural diversity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphins have a long history of interaction with humans and have
              been associated with positive and friendly encounters. <br> They are
              often portrayed as friendly and helpful creatures in stories and
              folklore, <br> and they have been known to approach and interact
              playfully with swimmers, surfers, and boats.

          <h2>Panda</h2>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">
            The giant panda is a bear species endemic to China. It is
            characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body
          </p>
          <h3>Habitat</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Sichuan</li>
            <li>Shaanxi</li>
            <li>Gansu</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Diet</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bamboo</li>
            <li>fruits</li>
            <li>leaves</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>
            <li>roots</li>
            <li>shoots</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Characteristics</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Size and Appearance</strong> <br>
              Giant pandas are large bears, with males typically weighing
              between 220 and 250 pounds <br> (100 to 115 kilograms) and measuring
              around 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) in length. <br> Females are
              smaller, weighing between 150 and 220 pounds (68 to 100
              kilograms). <br> They have a robust body, with a round face, large
              head, and black fur on their ears, <br> eye patches, limbs, and
              shoulders. The rest of their body is covered in dense, <br> woolly fur
              that is mostly white with black patches.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adaptations</strong><br>
              andas have several unique adaptations that help them survive in
              their bamboo forest habitat. <br> They have a "pseudo-thumb" or an
              extension of the wrist bone that functions like a thumb, <br> allowing
              them to grasp bamboo stems and manipulate objects. <br> Their jaws are
              strong, and their molars and premolars are broad and flat, <br>
              enabling them to chew and crush bamboo effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Diet</strong><br>
              As mentioned earlier, the giant panda's diet primarily consists of
              bamboo. <br> They have a specialized digestive system that allows them
              to extract nutrients from bamboo, <br> despite its low nutritional
              value. However, pandas also have the ability to eat other foods
              such <br> as fruits, vegetables, and occasionally small mammals or
              eggs, although these items <br> make up a very small proportion of
              their diet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Habitat</strong><br>
              Giant pandas inhabit the mountainous regions of central China,
              where they live in dense <br> bamboo forests at elevations between
              1,200 and 3,500 meters (4,000 to 11,500 feet) above sea level. <br>
              They require a large area of undisturbed bamboo forest to meet
              their dietary needs and to maintain a stable population.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Behavior</strong><br>
              Pandas are generally solitary animals, with individuals occupying
              home ranges that overlap with those of other pandas. <br> They are
              primarily active during the day and spend a significant amount of
              time foraging and feeding on bamboo. <br> Pandas are adept climbers and
              often retreat to trees to rest or escape from predators. They are
              also good swimmers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conservation Status</strong><br>
              The giant panda is listed as a vulnerable species by the
              International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). <br> They have
              faced threats such as habitat loss, fragmentation, and poaching.
              However, <br> significant conservation efforts have been made to
              protect and restore their habitat, <br> and their population has shown
              some positive recovery in recent years.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Fun facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Giant pandas are known for their distinct black and white
              markings, <br> which help camouflage them in their bamboo forest
              habitat and provide <br> effective camouflage in the snowy landscapes
              of their native regions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite their bear-like appearance, pandas have a diet that is
              primarily herbivorous. <br> They are one of the few bear species that
              are mainly vegetarian, feeding almost exclusively on bamboo.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pandas have a specialized "thumb" or an extension of their wrist
              bone that functions like a thumb. <br> This adaptation allows them to
              grasp bamboo stems and efficiently strip the leaves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pandas have a unique way of marking their territory. <br> They use
              scent marking, such as rubbing their bodies against trees or
              urinating on objects, <br> to communicate their presence and establish
              boundaries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Baby pandas, called cubs, are born blind and are extremely small
              and fragile. <br> They are about the size of a stick of butter and
              weigh only 3.5 to 5 ounces (100 to 150 grams) at birth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pandas are excellent climbers and are capable of climbing trees,
              even though they are quite heavy. <br> Their climbing ability allows
              them to access bamboo shoots at higher elevations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pandas have a specialized digestive system, but it is not very
              efficient at extracting nutrients from bamboo. <br> As a result, they
              have to consume a large volume of bamboo to meet their nutritional
              needs, <br> spending about 10 to 16 hours a day feeding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite their large size, pandas have a gentle temperament and are
              generally docile. <br> They are often depicted as adorable and cuddly
              creatures, <br> which contributes to their popularity and conservation
              efforts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pandas have been a symbol of conservation and wildlife
              preservation. <br> They are considered a flagship species for
              biodiversity conservation in China and around the world. <br> Their
              iconic image has helped raise awareness and support for the
              protection of their habitat and other endangered species.
